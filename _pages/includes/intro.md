Xincao Xu (Chinese character 许新操 or 許新操) received his Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from the College of Computer Science at Chongqing University ([CQU](https://www.cqu.edu.cn)), Chongqing, China, in 2023. He previously earned his B.S. degree in Network Engineering from the School of Computer and Control Engineering at the North University of China ([NUC](https://www.nuc.edu.cn)), Taiyuan, China, in 2017. Dr. Xu is currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow, working in cooperation with Prof. [Shaohua Wan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IhjhNEEAAAAJ&hl=en) at the Shenzhen Institute for Advanced Study, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China ([UESTC](https://www.uestc.edu.cn)), in Shenzhen. He has authored and co-authored more than 10 papers with total google scholar <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DK5avZUAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2FNeardws%2Fneardws.github.io@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>. 
       
His research is primarily focused on several cutting-edge areas, including: 
- AI for Driving, covering aspects like heterogeneous information fusion, cooperative sensing, multimodal deep learning, and driving behavior control.
- Vehicular Networks, with a focus on cooperative transmission and computing, integrated sensing and communications, and resource allocation.
- Vehicular Cyber-Physical Systems, encompassing sensing, transmitting, modeling, and controlling.
- Edge Computing, emphasizing the offloading of communication, computing, and caching abilities from the cloud to the network edge.
- Deep Reinforcement Learning, including multi-agent DRL, hierarchical DRL, and the integration of DRL with other technologies such as game theory and evaluation algorithms.
- Game Theory, with a specific interest in potential games, matching, auctions, and related concepts.
